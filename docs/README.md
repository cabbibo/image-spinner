Lightweight Script to spin images, and examples on how to use it.
Works best in chrome, and although it functions in other canvas enabled browsers, 
it tends to be prohibatively slow.

All that is needed to use the script is to call 

initImage(imgSrc,objWidth,objRatio,posX,posY,speeds,startAngle)

wherever you want to initialize the object.

Included as well is creator.js which adds functionality to initImage, in order to randomly generate shapes.

If you use this code, please let me know, so I can feel warm inside.
Feedback is GREATLY appreciated.
